This Project was Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPVzx1ZOVuw">Javascript Mastery</a>.
```

## Technology Stack

In this project, I used [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), I didn't use any backend because i just grabbed the API from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/), and i used [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for the UI.
